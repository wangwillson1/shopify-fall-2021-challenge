# Shopify Fall 2021 Challenge
Welcome to my image repository for the Shopify Fall 2021 challenge!

## Setting up the Project
The project contains two folders, the app and client. The app consists of an API made with Express/Node and the client was made with React. Navigate to the README in each of the folders to set up and run those projects.

## What's the images folder?
The images folder just contains some images you can use to test the image repository (i.e uploading to it). You are free to use your own images, but the folder is there in case you don't want to do that.

## How to use the application
### How do I view public images?
Any images that were set to public when uploaded will be automatically shown on the homepage (http://localhost:3000). Under each image will also be an option to view the original (full) image. If there are no public images, then a message will be displayed, indicating there are no images available.

### How do I create an account?
Click the "Sign Up" tab in the top right and fill in your information. After signing up, you will automatically be logged in.

### How do I sign in?
If you've already created an account, you can sign in by going to the "Login" tab and entering your credentials.

### How do I log out?
When you're logged in, there will be a "Logout" button in the top right. Click it and you'll be logged out.

### How do I upload images?
Assuming you are logged in, navigate to the "Upload" tab in the top right. Here, you can select photos and set their visibilities. After clicking upload, you will receive a confirmation if the upload was successful, before getting redirected to the homepage.
You should then be able to see your images on the home page, assuming they were public. Note that you **must** be logged in to upload images. 

### How do I delete images?
Assuming you're logged in, navigate to the "My Images" tab in the top right to view all the images that you've uploaded. Beside the "View full image" button will be a "Delete image" button, where you can delete any images. Note that you can only delete images that you've uploaded.

## Things to try out (i.e cool features)
* Creating an account
* Trying to sign in with the wrong credentials
* Uploading public and private images and signing out
* Viewing full images
* Uploading multiple images at once
* Deleting images from the "My Images" tab

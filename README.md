# Shopify Fall 2021 Challenge
Welcome to my image repository for the Shopify Fall 2021 challenge!

## Setting up the Project
The project contains two folders, the app and client. The app consists of an API made with Express/Node and the client was made with React. Navigate to each of the folders to set up and run those projects.

## What's the images folder?
The images folder just contains some images you can use to test the image repository (i.e uploading to it). You are free to use your own images, but the folder is there in case you don't want to do that.

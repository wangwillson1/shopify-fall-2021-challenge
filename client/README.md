## Installing dependencies
Note that you will need Node.js to set up this project.
Assuming Node is installed and you have cloned this project already, navigate to this directory (in a terminal) and type `npm install`. This should install all the dependencies for the project.

## Running the client
In a terminal, navigate to the directory and type `npm start`. This will start the client and you will be able to see the image repository. If the window doesn't automatically open, the link is http://localhost:3000
Note that by default, there won't be any images on the front page.
